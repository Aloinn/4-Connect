Collaboration Project – Connect 4 (Python)

Goal: Get comfortable with Github and working in a group setting. Create a simple connect 4 game with two players.

Input/Data (Ric):
-	Data set for Input should be different from GUI
-	Responsible for making a data structure
-	Making data structure (putting all the pieces into place)
-	Game consists of two players
-	Create a function that returns the most recent position
-	Use object-oriented programming

GUI/Output (frame by frame feel) (Jonathan):
-	Game output shown in console
-	Clear console and re-print the board every time a move is made
-	Make a bounce animation	
-	Use tabs/literal characters to format the spacing

Algorithm (Dylan and Alain):
-	Matching algorithm (Whether or not the 4 blocks are connected)
